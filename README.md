# TBPS Team 8 - Analysis

Primary repo for the analysis work

analysisWL_8param.py is the current main python script for all angles

analysis_ThetaL_Scipy_constrained.py is best cript for costhetal analysis only

Requires iminuit install

Also needs data folders downloaded from teams --> 'predictions' and 'provisional_signals'

To process signals.pkl this should be downloaded from the data supplied by mitesh

These should be in the same folder as the script

May pass an error due to folders not present for saving plots
