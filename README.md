Main repo.

Click the branch button that says "main" with a dropdown, then select the relevant branch for the project

## How to add your code

Uploading code to the repos requires a bit of work, it's a bit too easy to accidentally delete other peoples work, add huge files, etc
The below sections should help guide you if you want to upload your own code to here

### Anti-social behaviour to be avoided

* Pushing into the repo your RAW data files = megabytes of files. Use the .gitignore file to exlude your data when committing/pushing!
* Committing/pushing/editing code on your local editor without fetching/pulling first. Pulling first is important for multiple people sharing a branch!

### If you're not sure but want to try

* Select the branch you want to start off with as the "base" for your new branch
* On the branch select, type in your new name for the branch you want to make for your code (something that makes sense)
* This will create your own "bubble" where you can upload things without fear of breaking someone else's stuff
* Be careful to make sure the new branch is selected in the tool you're using when uploading content
* It's best to make the repo before you start your new code so you can start in that new branch, sometimes you can delete your own code when trying to change branch
* Once you're happy with your code in your branch, let the whatsapp group know about it and we can merge it with the other branches :)

It's always best to make a copy of your files if you're checking out to a new branch or pulling from git - not all programs warn you about overwriting changes.

### If you're terrified
send your code to the whatsapp chats and we can upload it for you

### If you're queen
just commit easy

### If you're going insane 
seek therapy
